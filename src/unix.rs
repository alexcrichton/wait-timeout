//! Unix implementation of waiting for children with timeouts
//!
//! On unix, wait() and its friends have no timeout parameters, so there is
//! no way to time out a thread in wait(). From some googling and some
//! thinking, it appears that there are a few ways to handle timeouts in
//! wait(), but the only real reasonable one for a multi-threaded program is
//! to listen for SIGCHLD.
//!
//! With this in mind, the waiting mechanism with a timeout only uses
//! waitpid() with WNOHANG, but otherwise all the necessary blocking is done by
//! waiting for a SIGCHLD to arrive (and that blocking has a timeout). Note,
//! however, that waitpid() is still used to actually reap the child.
//!
//! Signal handling is super tricky in general, and this is no exception. Due
//! to the async nature of SIGCHLD, we use the self-pipe trick to transmit
//! data out of the signal handler to the rest of the application.
